Description: To begin with, I wrote a 1-bit full adder, and use 16 full adders to built the 16-bit RCA. I then used the assignternary_output=cond?High:Low; to build the mux. I combined mux with 2 16-bits RCAs to build the 32-bit CSA. Finally, I used a not gate, a mnux and the 32-bit CSA to build the 32-bits ALU.
